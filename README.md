# Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing (NLP): Bitcoin

In recent years, Bitcoin, a digital currency, is becoming more incredibly popular among investors. As shown in figure 1, the price of bitcoin surged dramatically from USD400 in 2016 to USD46,500 in 2021. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis is to better understand the recent context of bitcoin in form of tweets and news articles for new investors in the crypto market.

Part I: Data collection 

There are two main sources used to gather text related to bitcoin. The first source is Twitter where the bitcoin word contains in tweets. The second source is bitcoin news articles from various sites such as Yahoo Finance, Cointelegraph, Reddit, and Bloomberg which were collected by using Google Search. Most of these sites are well-known among financial and bitcoin communities. However, there is a limitation in Google Search which is the maximum length of the results. Therefore, for some articles, the headers were cut-off.

Part II: Data structuring

Based on the data gather, there are two analyses that will be performed. The first framework is the sentiment analysis on the recent news articles which aimed to analyze the bitcoin market in terms of attitudes expressed in texts such as positive, negative, and uncertainty. Loughran dictionary will be used in this analysis since it contains the sentiments that better describe and more reasonable within the context of financial data such as litigious, uncertainty. Another framework used in the analysis is term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) from Twitter and all news articles which will help find the important words from each source so that investors can focus on before making a decision.

Part III: Analysis

According to the sentiment analysis, there is a relatively well-balanced between positive and negative coverage of the recent news articles, as shown in figure 2. Although there would seem to be an upward trend in investing in bitcoin, which can frequently see in the current headlines such as profitability and leading words, there are also significant factors which investors should be concerned about, especially for those who are risk averse also known as conservative investors. This can clearly see that volatility is the most frequent word in both negative and uncertainty sentiments. Another consideration is the regulation within litigious sentiment which potentially be one of the main concerns since there is no physical bitcoin, no banks, or government back up. Therefore, there might be an issue with legal claims.
In another analysis from the TF-IDF framework, there are several aspects that investors should know before investing in bitcoin as shown in figure 4. The most important words from each source are as follows:

•	Hash Rate: bitcoin’s network measuring unit indicates three aspects; healthy, power, and profitability. 
•	Ether: another digital currency that can be traded via online exchanges.
•	Elon Musk: Tesla’s CEO whose company recently bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin and planning to accept bitcoin as a form of payment. 
•	Guggenheim: an asset management firm that has over USD230 billion AUM. The company is also interested in investing in bitcoin.
•	Cannabis: based on external research, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is one of the payment solutions in the Cannabis industry. This is caused by the difficulty in traditional payment within banking industries. Hence, cannabis entrepreneurs utilize bitcoin to solve this issue.

Part IV: Conclusion

With all things considered, bitcoin has undoubtedly been an attractive market as can obviously see from an increase in the stock price over time as well as the positive words in news headlines. Although many companies and investors are talking about bitcoin these days, there are good reasons to be concerned about risks, particularly risk averse investors. As seen in the sentiment analysis, there are uncertainty, constraints, and regulation associated with bitcoin, so investors should study the information and do the risk-return tradeoff before making any decision.
